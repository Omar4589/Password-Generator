Struggling to come up with a strong and secure password?

Click the "Generate Password" button to generate a random password.

After you click the button, you will be prompted with a couple of questions:  
 1."How many characters should your password include?" Enter a number between 8 and 128 using numeric values.  
 2."Include lowercase letters in the password?" - Click "OK" for Yes & "Cancel" for No.  
 3."Include uppercase letters in the password?" - Click "OK" for Yes & "Cancel" for No.  
 3."Include numbers in the password?" - Click "OK" for Yes & "Cancel" for No.  
 4."Include special characters in the password?" - Click "OK" for Yes & "Cancel" for No.

A password will be generated after the password criteria is chosen.  
_If invalid inputs are entered, you will be alerted & asked to try again._
