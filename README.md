 2."Include lowercase letters in the password?" Click "OK" for YES & "Cancel" for NO.  
 3."Include uppercase letters in the password?" Click "OK" for YES & "Cancel" for NO.  
 3."Include numbers in the password?" Click "OK" for YES & "Cancel" for NO.

A password will be generated after the password criteria is chosen.  
_If invalid inputs are entered, you will be alerted & asked to try again._
